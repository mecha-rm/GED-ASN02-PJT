Welcome to Animal Party Extravaganza, the GDW game for Team Outkasts!
In this game you collect a flag and try to reach some pre-determined score in order to win, competing with 2-4 Players.
First, let's go over some information regarding the controls and user interface.

-- PAGE 1 --
In the top top left of the screen is the timer, which normally counts down to end the match if no one reaches the win condition.
For this tutorial, the timer does not effect the gameplay. 
To the top right of the screen you will see the current step.
When you complete said step, it will go onto the next one. This is tutorial exclusive.

-- PAGE 2 --
At the bottom left is the player's current score.
The score increases when the player obtains the flag, which is shown via an indicator above their head.
At the centre top of the screen, the win condition is shown.
If you fall off the world, then you will return to your spawn position and lose the flag if you are holding it.
However, at the time of this build there is no score penalty for death.
If you meet the win condition, you will go to the end screen.
Now onto the controls...

Controls:
(W) = Move Forward. 
(A/LEFT ARROW) = Turn Left. 
(D/RIGHT ARROW) = Turn Right. 
(S) = Move Backwards. 
(DOWN ARROW) = Turnaround (Quick Turn).
(SPACE BAR/UP ARROW) = Jump

With all that out of the way, try moving around and following the steps.
The flag is on top of the wall near the platforms. So just use said platforms to scale it.
Hit the 'Finish' button to close out the dialogue window.

You're almost done the tutorial! Just touch the flag in order to start getting points!
If you die, the flag will return to this spot so you can grab it again.
After you grab it, just wait until you get enough points, and you will be taken to the end screen.
